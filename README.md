## üèÅ Quick Start (PWA Version)

Follow these steps to get the PWA version running locally.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher.
2.  **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
3.  **Google Maps API Key**: Required for route calculation, geocoding, and map generation.
4.  **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: Required for fetching weather data.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Martini310/Trip_Cost_Calc.git
    cd Trip_Cost_Calc
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm run install:all
    ```
    *(This command installs both frontend and backend dependencies.)*

3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project:
    ```env
    # .env file
    API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
    WEATHER_API=your_openweathermap_api_key
    ```

    Create a `.env.local` file in the `/frontend` directory of the project:
    ```env
    # .env.local file
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
    ```
    *Note: For the frontend's "My Location" feature, there should be the Google Maps API Key configured as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in the frontend's environment setup or Vercel deployment settings.*

4.  **Start the development servers**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command starts both the Next.js frontend (typically on `http://localhost:3000`) and the Flask backend (typically on `http://localhost:5001`).

## üìà API Endpoints (Backend)

The Flask backend exposes the following endpoints:

### `POST /calculate-trip`

Calculates trip cost and details based on provided parameters.

**Request Body Example:**
```json
{
  "origin": "Warsaw, Poland",
  "destination": "Krakow, Poland",
  "fuel_type": "PB95",
  "consumption": 7.5
}
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "trip_cost": 45.67,
  "distance_text": "295 km",
  "distance_value": 295000,
  "duration_text": "3 hours 15 mins",
  "duration_value": 11700,
  "price": 6.23,
  "weather_description": ["partly cloudy", 10000],
  "origin": "Warsaw, Poland",
  "destination": "Krakow, Poland",
  "fuel_type": "PB95",
  "consumption": 7.5,
  "map_url": "/map-image"
}
```

### `GET /map-image`

Serves the generated route map image used in the response of `/calculate-trip`.

### `GET /geocode`
Performs reverse geocoding to convert geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) into a human-readable address. This is primarily used by the "My Location" feature on the frontend.

**Query Parameters:**
```
lat (required): The latitude of the location.
lng (required): The longitude of the location.
```

**Example Request:**
```
/geocode?lat=52.2297&lng=21.0122
```
**Response Example:**

*Returns the JSON response directly from the Google Maps Geocoding API.*
```
{
  "results": [
    {
      "formatted_address": "Warsaw, Poland",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "status": "OK"
}
```

### `GET /health`
A simple health check endpoint used for monitoring to confirm that the API server is running and responsive.

**Response Example:**
```
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

### `GET /`
Root endpoint. Returns API info and available endpoints.

```
{
  "message": "Trip Cost Calculator API",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "endpoints": {
    "geocode": "/geocode",
    "calculate_trip": "/calculate-trip",
    "map_image": "/map-image",
    "health": "/health"
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Development Setup

### Frontend Development

Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
This starts the Next.js development server.

### Backend Development

Run the Flask API server:
```bash
python api_server.py
```
This starts the Flask backend server.

### Building for Production

To build the PWA frontend for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
To start the production server (after building):
```bash
npm start
```

## üîë API Key Configuration Details

A single Google Maps API key is required for both the frontend and backend.

### Google Maps API Key

*   **Purpose**: Used for backend (directions, geocoding, static maps) and frontend (geolocation, reverse geocoding).
*   **Required APIs to Enable**:
    *   Maps JavaScript API
    *   Geocoding API
    *   Directions API
    *   Static Maps API
    *   Geolocation API


### OpenWeatherMap API Key

*   **Purpose**: Used by the backend to fetch weather data.
*   **Obtaining**: Sign up on the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/api).

---

## üîç Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks

The backend includes a `/health` endpoint for monitoring:
```bash
curl https://your-backend/health
# Expected response: {"status": "healthy"}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1.  **CORS Errors**: Ensure the Flask backend is configured to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests.
2.  **Map Images Not Loading**: Verify the backend is running, accessible, and serving the `/map-image` endpoint correctly. Check network requests in the browser's developer console. Ensure HTTPS is used consistently.
3.  **"My Location" Button Not Working**: Confirm `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is correctly set in environment variables. Check the browser console for specific API errors and ensure the user has granted location permissions.
4.  **API Key Issues**: Double-check that API keys are correctly set in environment variables for both backend and frontend. Ensure all required Google Maps APIs are enabled and quotas are not exceeded.
5.  **Port Conflicts**: Make sure port `5001` is available and correctly exposed in your mikr.us container configuration.

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test backend connectivity and response
curl -v https://your-backend/health

# Test POST request to the calculation endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-backend/calculate-trip \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"origin":"Warsaw","destination":"Krakow","fuel_type":"PB95","consumption":7.0}'

# View Docker container logs (replace 'your-container-name' if different)
docker logs trip_calculator_api
```

## üîí Security Considerations

*   **API Keys**: **Never** commit sensitive API keys directly into your code or version control. Use `.env` files and environment variables securely.
*   **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for communication in production environments.
*   **CORS**: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) strictly, allowing requests only from your frontend's domain.
*   **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting on your API endpoints to prevent abuse.
*   **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs on the backend to prevent security vulnerabilities.

---

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

*   **Container Resources**: Monitor resource usage (CPU, Memory) and adjust container settings if necessary.
*   **API Usage**: Keep track of your Google Maps and OpenWeatherMap API usage to manage costs and stay within free tier limits where possible.
*   **Caching**: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data or calculations to reduce redundant API calls.
*   **CDN**: Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for serving static frontend assets if needed, though Vercel handles this efficiently by default.
